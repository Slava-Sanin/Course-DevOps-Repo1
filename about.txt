I am passionate about discovering how everyday programs and devices work, and Iâ€™m excited to start learning programming for myself. For me, studying programming is a way to unlock my creative potential, develop logical thinking, and try building my own useful applications and small projects. My goal is to master the basics so I can solve academic tasks and use my knowledge to bring my own ideas to life in the future.
